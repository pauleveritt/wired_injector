# Caveats

If you:

- Hate *type hints*?
  * You'll certainly hate protocols
- Think Python is for scripting?
  * Probably hate this.... -ish?
- Are coolio with [nominal subtyping](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/#nominal-vs-structural-subtyping) (i.e. subclassing)?
  * Embrace your inheritance and abc's, skip this

If you:

- Agree with GoF [composition over inheritance](https://python-patterns.guide/gang-of-four/composition-over-inheritance/)?
  * Read on
- Need replaceable, pluggable system?
  * Multiple implementations of a "thing"
  * Now you're speaking my language
