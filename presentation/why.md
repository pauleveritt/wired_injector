# Why

We'll see more later. But this is such a hard sell, let's set markers early.

- I'm making a `Greeter`...did I get it right?
- Red squiggles
    * The benefit of "fail faster"
    * In the IDE (duh)
    * Static analysis in CI
    * Navigation, autocomplete etc. in code *and* tests
- Large-scale "pluggable apps"
- Design Patterns, Uncle Bob's open/closed in [SOLID](https://stackify.com/solid-design-open-closed-principle/), Bertrand Meyer [Design By Contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) 
  * This isn't about "Java"
  * It's about scalable designs
